Testing:

Zunbils still have 2 caste types. Check?
Need to test joining the coven as a hellenic male or gay female

Fixes:

Make Egyptian pagan and African religions have African shield in character view.

Rise to Power:

Will I need to add anything to nomad bows? Crowns: crown or head slot? Also Chinese silk robes.
rtp_is_theocracy = {, rtp_is_republic = {, rtp_is_holy_order = {, & rtp_is_feudal = {
rtp_laws religious customs clergy obligations

Fix 'gender_succ = agnatic' This might be useful:

OR = {
	is_female = no
	gender_equality_trigger = yes
}

Does rtp_no_loans_st include emf loans?

Do I need have_gender_laws = yes etc. from TiaraMod in: !!!rtp_landless_governments, !!rtp_baron_governments, !rtp_governments, chivalry_governments etc.
