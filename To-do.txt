Testing:

Zunbils still have 2 caste types. Check?
Need to test joining the coven as a hellenic male or gay female
Does it notify me if I develop sympathy for African religions?
%Find the un-iconed trait(s). Probably multiples from Acid's mods.

Fixes:

Make Egyptian pagan and African religions have African shield in character view.
*Add coa's for Indo-Rome religions. (Vietimithraic, Heraclemasculist, Romantic = Hellenic; Borealic = Tengri).
*Add debug options to Sketchy's cheat menu.
*Playable Republic still isn't using the correct icon.
?Reformed pagan theocracies use playable republic.
*Make Sketchy's Education traits acquireable in game play. Builder = Stewardship, Politician = Diplomacy and Intrigue, Commander = Martial.

Will I need to add anything to nomad bows? Crowns: crown or head slot? Also Chinese silk robes.
rtp_is_theocracy = {, rtp_is_republic = {, rtp_is_holy_order = {, & rtp_is_feudal = {
rtp_laws religious customs clergy obligations

Fix 'gender_succ = agnatic' This might be useful:

OR = {
	is_female = no
	gender_equality_trigger = yes
}

Add warrior lodge leader traits to Warrior Societies (HIP).
Does rtp_no_loans_st include emf loans?
Do we need domestic_law.gfx or province.gfx?
